AI CHATBOT WITH NLP

COMPANY:CODTECH IT SOLUTION

NAME:V.MADHUMITHA

INTERN ID:CT04WQE

DOMAIN:PYTHON

DURATION:4 WEEKS

MENTOR:NEELA SANTOSH

DESCRIPTION:
This project is a simple AI chatbot built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in Python. The chatbot processes user input, identifies relevant responses, and replies accordingly. It utilizes NLTK for text preprocessing and TF-IDF with cosine similarity for intelligent response selection.

Features
 Tokenizes and removes stopwords from user input
 Uses TF-IDF Vectorization to understand the input
 Implements cosine similarity to find the most relevant response
 Provides predefined responses for common queries
 Handles unknown inputs with a default response

Technologies Used
Python 
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
Scikit-learn (for TF-IDF and cosine similarity)

How to Run the Chatbot
1️ Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chatbot_project.git
cd chatbot_project
2️ Install dependencies:
pip install nltk scikit-learn
3️ Run the chatbot:
python main.py
4️ Type messages and interact with the chatbot! Type "exit" to quit.

Future Improvements
 Expand chatbot responses using a larger dataset
 Integrate with an API for real-time information
 Implement a deep learning model for better accuracy
